=== Introduction

This short note is intended to provide a scientific motivation for the code in this directory. This should be understood as a worked out example of the theory developed in the papers, see <<FA_review>> and Appendix A of <<top_prot>>.

Bla bla bla, at the end of the day you want to compute the single layer potential evaluated at the spherical harmonics.
